# TomeRater
## Capstone Project for Python Intensive Course @ CodeAcademy

### The project was the culmination of a 9 week intensive course to learn Python. In this project I have two base classes:

  Users:  name, email and a dictionary of books they have rated
  
  Books:  title, ISBN and a list of ratings from users

### There are also two sub-classes based on the Books class.

  Fiction:  title, ISBN, author
  Non_Fiction:  title, ISBN, subject, level
  
### The main python program TomeRater.py has several methods that use the classes and methods defined in the above.  This program manages the instances of these objects by creating users, books and ratings on the books.   The methods can be used to print out the list of users and a catalog of books.   Additional methods can review the objects searching for the highest rated book, most read book or the user providing the best ratings.

### The main program imports the classes and related methods from Books.py and Users.py.
